# Livewires Python Course #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/livewires/python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/livewires/python)

The LiveWires Python Course is intended to teach the [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language to people who have never programmed before. It includes:

* [worksheets](sheets/) for learning Python (by reading)
* a [package](module/) (which you will need for the code in the worksheet to run).

## Getting the package ##

You can find the package on the [downloads page](https://github.com/livewires/python/releases), or on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/LiveWires).

## Getting the sheets ##

The worksheets are built by Travis CI, and a tarball is output [here](http://livewires-worksheets.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

## About the course ##

On the LiveWires Scripture Union camp in 1999, we taught a computer language called Python for the first time. We've carried on using it on the holiday every summer since then.

To help us teach Python to the young people on the holiday, the LiveWires team produced a set of worksheets and a Python package (the LiveWires package) to go with them. We've decided to make these available to the world at large under open source licences. “Open source” means that, subject to a few conditions, anyone can copy and modify this work. It's our way of giving something back to the Python community. (See the licence for more details.)
